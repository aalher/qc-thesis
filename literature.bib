%%% Recommended source for BibTeX entries: https://dblp.org/
%%% Still, you might want to post-process some of the DBLP BibTeX entries ...

%%% ... like changing to titlecase in the title and series fields below and probably removing the DBLP-specific fields timestamp, biburl, and bibsource
@book{jurafsky:2009,
  author    = {Dan Jurafsky and
               James H. Martin},
  title     = {Speech and Language Processing: An Introduction to Natural Language
               Processing, Computational Linguistics, and Speech Recognition, 2nd
               Edition},
  series    = {Prentice Hall Series in Artificial Intelligence},

  url       = {https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/315913020},
  isbn      = {9780135041963}
}

%%% Recommended bibkeys: <last name first author>:<year> 
%%% (in case of a key collision add a, b, c, ... at the end)

%%% Ordering your bibfile by key helps quick browsing w/o need to CTRL+F

}

%%% Another change to DBLP BibTeX entries: spelling out journal names like here

}

%%% When some BibTeX entry is not available at DBLP, try to mimick DBLP's "look and feel" like below
@article{rosenblatt:1958,
  author    = {Frank Rosenblatt},
  title     = {The Perceptron: A Probabilistic Model for Information Storage and Organization in the Brain},
  journal   = {Psychological Review},
  volume    = {65},
  number    = {6},
  pages     = {386--408},
  year      = {1958}
}

%%% Finally, you will probably most often cite some conference papers; make sure to rather not fetch the cross-referenced BibTex entries from DBLP
%%% Suggested change to the standard BibTeX entry: endash (--) for the date range of a conference (like in the pages field)
